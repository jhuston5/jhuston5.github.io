# React and Forms

## [React Docs - Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)

What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

- A Controlled component is when an input form has their value controlled by React.

> The example indicats that this done by setting state equal to an object with a blank value, then creating a function that will update using setState to an event.target.value

Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

- We will not wait to update response from form into state. The standard handleChange function updates React state on every keystroke.

How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

> "When you need to handle multiple controlled input elements, you can add a name attribute to each element and let the handler function choose what to do based on the value of event.target.name."

In other words, we use event.target.name to identify the unique name we give to the element.

## [The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained](https://codeburst.io/javascript-the-conditional-ternary-operator-explained-cac7218beeff)

Why would we use a ternary operator?

It is shorter than a typical if statement. We can use it on instances of one conditional, multiple conditionals, and multiple operations. Syntax-wise I feel it is a lot like an Excel IF or IFS statement. 

Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
  if(x===y){
 console.log(true);
  } else {
 console.log(false);
  }

x === y ? true : false;
