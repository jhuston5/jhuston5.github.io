# Putting It All Together

## React Docs - Thinking in React

### What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?

Single responsibility has been applied in our learning to functions and objects. In the case of components it also means that a component needs to do just one thing, and if it grows “it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents”

### What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?

Essentially it means to build a version that does not have any interactivity. No state, just a way to display the data model. Can still use props to pass the data.

### Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?

You need to add state in order to make it interactive.

### What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?

1. Is it passed in from a parent via props? NOT STATE
2. Is it unchanged over time? NOT STATE
3. Can you compute it based on other state or props in your component? NOT STATE

### How can you identify where state needs to live?

Need to identify a common owner component, ie, a component that a level above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy.
> If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.

## Higher-Order Functions

### What is a “higher-order function”?

> Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them.

In other words, we can pass through actions as well as values.

### Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?

Line two of this greater than function is its own mini function, ie. This one can’t do anything on its own, but it can be used and pass through other functions. It does this later on and returns true.

### Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.

This function demonstrates at a high level what map does every time it is called
function map(array, transform) {
  let mapped = [];
  for (let element of array) {
    mapped.push(transform(element));
  }
  return mapped;
}

It takes a common functionality that is needed and standardizes it with the map or reduce keyword

### Things  I want to know more about

- component mutation (or owning) state
