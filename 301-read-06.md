# Node.js

## An Introduction to Node.js

What is node.js?
From what I am gathering from the reading, node.js is a system that passes apps through an event loop and run Javascript on a server.

The reading has a more opaque definition.
> Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

The V8 Javascript engine allows Javascript to be compiled as machine code that our computer can use.

What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

> This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

What is npm?

Npm is a package manager for Node.

What version of node are you running on your machine?

v14.18.0

What version of npm are you running on your machine?\

6.14.15

What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

- *npm install -g jshint*

What is node used for?

Node is used to automate different parts of writing programs in Javascript. In addition, Node executes in a single-thread, event-driven fashion. This enables speedy execution for a server.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

I've found paired programming to be extremely helpful with obtaining greater efficiency. I know it takes two people doing "one person's" work, but for me it has resulted in creating better code, cleaner programs, and solving problems much more rapidly.

How does pair programming work?
Pair programming involves a driver and a navigator. The driver has hands on the keyboard, typing code. The navigator does not have their hands on the keyboard, but is still fully engaged. They help look for errors, debug in real time, and think about how to write the current code.

### Things I want to know more about

I'm really interested in what types of things Node helps automate, and what its relationship is with other frameworks we are using.
