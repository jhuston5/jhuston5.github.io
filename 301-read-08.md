## REST

What does REST stand for?
REST stands for Representational State Transfer

REST APIs are designed around a resource.

What is an identifer of a resource? Give an example.
An Identifier is something that uniquely identifies that resource. I think an example could be our Offer Request IDs (ORIDs) that we use at Zillow.

What are the most common HTTP verbs?

- GET
- POST
- PUT
- PATCH
- DELETE

What should the URIs be based on?
> They should be based on the nouns (the resource) and not verbs (the operations on the resource)

Give an example of a good URI.
Example: https://adventure-works.com/**orders** // Good

What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?
Having a chatty API is a bad thing, as all requests strain the server. A chatty API is when you have a large number of small requests.

What status code does a successful GET request return?
HTTP status code 200 (OK)

What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?
404 (Not Found)

What status code does a successful POST request return?
HTTP status code 201 (Created)

What status code does a successful DELETE request return?
HTTP status code 204 (No Content)

### Things I want to know more about

> Avoid requiring resource URIs more complex than collection/item/collection.
Doesn't matter if you have a relationshional database under the hood, as long as you present a unified structure to the client.
