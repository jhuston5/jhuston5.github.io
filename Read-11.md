### Image Size

Just like we have been doing, use width and height to specify dimensions.

Many websites keep consistent image sizes across their sites. Definitely makes sense to me as it would be more pleasing from a visual perspective, as well as easier to work with as a developer.

### Background Images

background-image in CSS allows us to put images behind text.

background-repeat (combined with repeat x and repeat y) allows images to repeat horizontally, vertically, or both.

### Gradients & Contrast

Gradient can be set by specifying two colors to transition between

Contrast can assist with readability if utilizing the low contrast feature or a screen.

### SEO

SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. I've primarily understood this to be the domain of marketers, but it is obviously important for us to understand on the front end so that we can anticpate some of the needs and reduce work.

Essentially, we need to consider what search terms will be used by people searching for the type of content on our page, then consistently using those terms throughout the page.

#### On-Page Techniques

Include search terms in the page content and HTML.

7 major places we need to include:

1. Page Title
2. URL/Web Address
3. Headings
4. Text
5. Link Text
6. Image Alt Text
7. Page Descriptions

Google Analytics to see what is going on with your site.
