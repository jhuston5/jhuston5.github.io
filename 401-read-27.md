# Django Forms

We can use Forms to perform CRUD operations without using the Admin interface.

> Django Forms take a lot of the work out of all these steps, by providing a framework that lets you define forms and their fields programmatically, and then use these objects to both generate the form HTML code and handle much of the validation and user interaction.

The submit input will be displayed as a button (by default) that can be pressed by the user to upload the data in all the other input elements in the form to the server (in this case, just the team_name). The form attributes define the HTTP method used to send the data and the destination of the data on the server (action):

action: The resource/URL where data is to be sent for processing when the form is submitted. If this is not set (or set to an empty string), then the form will be submitted back to the current page URL.
method: The HTTP method used to send the data: post or get.
The POST method should always be used if the data is going to result in a change to the server's database because this can be made more resistant to cross-site forgery request attacks.
The GET method should only be used for forms that don't change user data (e.g. a search form). It is recommended for when you want to be able to bookmark or share the URL.

> Form data is stored in an application's forms.py file, inside the application directory. Create and open the file locallibrary/catalog/forms.py. To create a Form, we import the forms library, derive from the Form class, and declare the form's fields. A very basic form class for our library book renewal form is shown below — add this to your new file:

```Python
from django import forms

class RenewBookForm(forms.Form):
    renewal_date = forms.DateField(help_text="Enter a date between now and 4 weeks (default 3).")
```

### Common arguments for fields

1. required: If True, the field may not be left blank or given a None value. Fields are required by default, so you would set required=False to allow blank values in the form.
2. label: The label to use when rendering the field in HTML. If a label is not specified, Django will create one from the field name by capitalizing the first letter and replacing underscores with spaces (e.g. Renewal date).
3. label_suffix: By default, a colon is displayed after the label (e.g. Renewal date​:). This argument allows you to specify a different suffix containing other character(s).
4. initial: The initial value for the field when the form is displayed.
5. widget: The display widget to use.
6. help_text (as seen in the example above): Additional text that can be displayed in forms to explain how to use the field.
7. error_messages: A list of error messages for the field. You can override these with your own messages if needed.
8. validators: A list of functions that will be called on the field when it is validated.
9. localize: Enables the localization of form data input (see link for more information).
10. disabled: The field is displayed but its value cannot be edited if this is True. The default is False.
