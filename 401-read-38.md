# React 2

React is very useful because we can map out what we want each component to look like and do. Then, we can easily build static versions. Finally, we can fill in with state to add functionality to the site. We can then pass the data down as props.

How to know if something is state vs props?

1. Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
2. Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
3. Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.

> Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.

>If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.
