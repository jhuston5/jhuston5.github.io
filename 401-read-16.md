# Serverless Functions

> Serverless is a cloud execution model that enables a simpler, more cost-effective way to build and operate cloud-native applications.

## Key Features

- routes resources to run code "on demand"
- scales resources to fit demand as it changes
- reduces resources to 0 when application closes

Backend cloud infrastructure is handed over to the cloud provider. Ostensibly gives the ability to focus on Front end and business logic.

In addition, businesses only pay when resources are being used.

> The term 'serverless' describes the customer's experience with those servers: they are invisible to the customer, who doesn't see them, manage them, or interact with them in any way.

> Serverless is a polyglot environment, enabling developers to code in any language or framework - Java, Python, node.js - with which they're comfortable.

### Cons

- Does not offer cost savings for steady/predictable processes
- Debugging can be difficult with distributed model
- Locked in to using the cloud vendor
