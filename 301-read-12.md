# CRUD

## [HTTP Status Codes](https://www.moesif.com/blog/technical/api-design/Which-HTTP-Status-Code-To-Use-For-Every-CRUD-App/)

In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:

- 100’s = informational status code, seems like more of a heads up that part of the request will needs some kind of change.

- 200’s = Success codes. Lets a client know that the request is good.
- 300’s = redirection codes. A resource isn't in the same spot/has been migrated. Requres a new request to the resource's new home.

- 400’s = client error codes. Something is causing an incorrect request to the server. From the reading there are a number of reasons why, including: timeouts, wrong URI, missing authentication.

- 500’s = server error codes. Again, a number of reasons. Can be due to server issues (too many requests, unreachable server). However, this can also be a client request issue that causes problems with the server. Best practice is to retry request.

*What is a status code 202?*

A status code 202 is a valid request that is still being processed.
> The response body should include an URL to the finished resource with some information about when it will be available, or an URL to some monitoring endpoint that tells the client when the resource is available.

*What is a status code 308?*

> Like the 202 code but using a Location header field in response to informing the client about the location of the created resource or an endpoint that lets the client check for the status of the creation process.

What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?

- **204 No Content**

What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?

- **410 Gone**

What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?

> The client has authorized or doesn’t need to authorize itself, but still has no permissions to access the resource.

Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?

- We need to pull our database string out of the server and into our .env so we can continue to refresh and make changes without the string itself being exposed on our public application. We also want to avoid using our local host.

### Things I want to know more about

- I need to make sure I am very solid about how the REST HTTP requests pair to CRUD operations.
