# [How to use Random Module](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/random/how-to-use-the-random-module-in-python)

import random allows us to generate random numbers.

Examples:

- Pick a random page in your website
- Generate a random number for a video game feature
- Pick a random element from a list
- Make a password database more secure

**randint(low_num, high_num)** allows us to select a random number between two integers, a low and a high.

**random()** allows us to multiply by a number to get a larger one.
Ex: random.random() * 100

**random.choice()** - pick a random *value* from a sequence (ex. and array of strings)
Can be used to choose a random element from a list.

**shuffle()** moves around elements in a list so they are in random order.

**randrange(start stope [, step])** Generate a randomly selected element from range.

## What is Risk Analysis

Risk = the probability of an unwanted incident. I know just enough about this to know that with hundreds, thousands, and millions of users someone is going to find a way to use your site in a way that is unexpected.

Engineering leaders use risk analysis at the beginning of a project.
Potential Risks:

1. Use of new hardware
2. Use of new technology
3. Use of new automation tool
4. The sequence of code
5. Availability of test resources for the application

Next, leaders have to assess the risk magnitude (High, Medium, or Low). This then helps to prioritize risk mitigation measures and resources.

Business Risk: risk from the company or customer vs the project
Testing Risk: understanding platform and testing tools
Premature Release Risk: risk with releasing untested or unready software
Software Risk: any risk involved with the software development lifecycle

## [Test Coverage](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestCoverage.html)

AKA Code Coverage. Used to find untested parts of a code base.
Can be a percentage number, but have to be sure it doesn't distract creating a bunch of tests for minor issues vs a few tests for major potential problems.

- Good rule of thumb for code coverage would be upper 80% to 90%

I really like this statement by the author:
> I would say you are doing enough testing if the following is true: You rarely get bugs that escape into production, and you are rarely hesitant to change some code for fear it will cause production bugs.

## Big O Notation

O(1) - constant with respect of size of the input ie the pigeon carrying the usb stick

O(n) - linear equation and how time scales with the input data.

Is it a linear relationship or a quadratic relationship?
