##Book Notes
###Introduction (pp.2-11)
###HTML Chapter 1: “Structure” (pp.12-39)
I have learned a lot recently about the interactions between HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

HTML really provides the structure or skeleton of the web page. CSS fleshes out the content, acting as the musculature and anatomy of the web. And Javascript is like the nervous system, allowing actions to happen throughout the site.

HTML was a bit odd to me at first, but now I'm trying to think of it structurally like a newspaper. Many of the tags are designed to create divisions and organization. Class and id tags are used for reference in follow up CSS and Javascript. 


###HTML Chapter 8: “Extra Markup” (p.176-199)
One habit I need to be better about is code documentation and notes. Using the <!--  --> tags in HTML will allow comments that don't directly affect the code. The biggest way this can help is with organization of my HTML. I like the differentiation of block and inline elements; I've struggled in the past deciding which tag to use to ensure elements are located on the right spot of the page.

###HTML Chapter 17: “HTML5 Layout” (pp.428-451)
For someone with a military background, the rate of change in the progamming world can seem scary. However, in many cases these changes can bring welcome features. A great example is HTML 5 and the new elements used to organize the page. Instead of having to use many <div> elements, more specific tags like <nav>, <header>, <article>, and <aside> have been created. My main job will be keeping these straight in my head and knowing what each function does. 


###HTML Chapter 18: “Process & Design” (pp.452-475)
Design. Likely not my strong suit - I've never really been creative or able to make things very pleasing to the eye. When I put my mind to it, I CAN make things organized. I think clarity and simplicity will be what I keep in mind the most when creating or editing a website. Creating a site map is crucial. I feel that I need to do this as well when starting my code - some kind of outline to keep myself on course rather than ramble. Concise, clear, selective, context, interactive, consistent. 


###Introduction
###JS Chapter 1: “The ABC of Programming” (pp.11-52)
One of my biggest priorities with Javascript is developing a deep understanding of the main structures within the language -e.g. Object, Methods, Functions, Arrays, Keys. As I was first learning them I didn't have it straight in my head, which made things much more difficult as I tried to learn more advanced algorithms.

So, I'll attempt to set everything straight here. 

1. An OBJECT contains information about a thing. For example, a real world OBJECT such as a car has a lot of information associated with it - color, make, model, and much more. OBJECTS contain this information. OBJECTS can also have their own PROPERTIES, EVENTS, and METHODS.

- PROPERTIES are the characteristics of an OBJECT. Every property has a name:value pair. For example, Make:Chevrolet.

- An EVENT is an interaction. 

- A METHOD is typically an instruction that affects an OBJECT. This task can interact with an OBJECT, such as a hotel METHOD to cancelBooking().

2. EVENT > trigger a METHOD > METHOD retrieve or update OBJECT PROPERTY. 

                                      method
                               _______________________ 
3. CALLING a METHOD. EX: document.write('Good Afternoon');
                          ^   ^           ^
                       object|member operator|parameter
