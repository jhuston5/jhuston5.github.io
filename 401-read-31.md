# Django REST Framework & Docker

## [Docker](https://wsvincent.com/beginners-guide-to-docker/)

Docker isolates applications so they are OS agnostic.

> The entire development environment is isolated: programming language, software packages, databases, and more.

Docker is similar to a virtual machine. Under the hood it is Linux containers.

By using Linux, the virtual environment allows replication of the same power of a local machine without using a ton of resources.

From that point we need to install all packages that we need.

In a nutshell:

1. Docker is a way to run Linux containers
2. Containers are a lightweight alternative to Virtual Machines
3. Dockerfile is a list of instructions for creating an image
4. Images are made up of one or more layers
5. Containers are a running instance of an image
6. docker-compose.yml controls how to run the container
7. Containers are stateless and ephemeral in nature. We can link the local filesystem via volumes but things become more complex with databases (which we didnâ€™t cover here).

## [Django For APIs](https://djangoforapis.com/library-website-and-api/)

> The most important takeaway is that Django creates websites containing webpages, while Django REST Framework creates web APIs which are a collection of URL endpoints containing available HTTP verbs that return JSON.

After you create a typical Django project, you can add an apis app, then add to the INSTALLED_APPS section ["apis.apps.ApisConfig"].

Add an API endpoint to the project urls file: path("api/", include("apis.urls")),

Create an api app urls file, add a new view.

Now instead of using the views to render a web page, we use it to transfer JSON data. Can be called apiviews.py or api.py file.

Use serializer to change into JSON.
