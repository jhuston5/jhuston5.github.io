# Reading 11 Jupyter Lab & Numpy

## Jupyter Lab

Jupyter has built in text, code consoles and terminals. It can also support a ton of different file types.

Jupyter Notebooks

- Command Mode
- Notebook and cells
- Edit Mode - Uses markdown

## [Numpy Tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/numpy-tutorial-python/)

Numpy works under the hood with other packages in Python.


Example Analysis Project:
Import a csv, use a csv.reader 

Sample Code
```Python
import csv
with open('winequality-red.csv', 'r') as f:
    wines = list(csv.reader(f, delimiter=';'))
```

We can use Numpy to work with Matrices (multi-dimensional arrays).
In a Numpy array the number of dimensions is a rank and each dimenson is an axis. Rows are the first axis and columns are the second axis.

A numpy.array function can take in a list of lists and create a NumPy array from it.

> One of the limitations of NumPy is that all the elements in an array have to be of the same type, so if we include the header row, all the elements in the array will be read in as strings.

The *shape* property can check the number of rows and columns.

>  One important thing to keep in mind is that just like Python lists, NumPy is zero-indexed, meaning that the index of the first row is 0, and the index of the first column is 0. 

We can take a slice of an array using a colon.

Example of selecting 3 elements from the fourth column: wines[0:3,3]

Slice all elements in the fourth column: wines[:,3]

Assign a value directly to an index: wines[1,5] = 10

We can also use Numpy to get 1 dimensional arrays, or vectors (for example, just slicing one row off the a 2-D array)

N-Dimensional Numpy Arrays

Quick reminder of some Python data types

- float — numeric floating point data.
- int — integer data.
- string — character data.
- object — Python objects.

>You can use the numpy.ndarray.astype method to convert an array to a different type. wines.astype(int)

Numpy Array Operations
Example: wines[:,11] + 10 would add 10 points to every number in the 12th row (which was quality). This returns a vector and won't change the original array.
If we want to change the original array, we would instead use += 

```Python
wines[:,11] += 10
wines[:,11]
```

### Subsetting
> One of the powerful things we can do with a Boolean array and a NumPy array is select only certain rows or columns in the NumPy array. For example, the below code will only select rows in wines where the quality is over 7:

```Python
high_quality = wines[:,11] > 7
wines[high_quality,:][:3,:]
```

### Combining NumPy Arrays

> With NumPy, it’s very common to combine multiple arrays into a single unified array. We can use numpy.vstack to vertically stack multiple arrays. Think of it like the second arrays’s items being added as new rows to the first array. We can read in the winequality-white.csv dataset that contains information on the quality of white wines, then combine it with our existing dataset, wines, which contains information on red wines.
