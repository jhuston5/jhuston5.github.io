From the Duckett HTML book:

## Chapter 2: “Text” (pp.40-61)
There is lots of functionality in both HTML and CSS to make visual changes to text throughout a web page. I am still working on gaining experience to determine which tool to use for different situations, but I feel confident in being able to make some text formatting changes using various tags in HTML.

Structure and Semantics - HTML is essentially creating an outline for a page, and then also has the functionality to place emphasis or guidance for the text.

## Chapter 10: Ch.10 “Introducing CSS” (pp.226-245)
CSS
> The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.

CSS can affect individual or grouped HTML elements by selecting a type element, or its specific class or id that one can assign within the HTML. 

It Cascades because it reads what is lowest within the CSS.

#### Selectors 
Last thing for me to remember in this section are the various selectors. Some of the ones that I am not as familiar with:

- child selector
- descendant selector
- adjacent sibling selector
- general sibling selector

Essentially, what I am going to recall from here is that different combos of selectors can target very specific elements of the HTML. 

Block vs Inline
Still need to work on controlling my block and in-line elements. Block elements start on a new line, while in-line element continue on the same line. 

## Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.53-84)

Variables and Data Types
- Numeric
- String
- Boolean

There's so much that one can do with Boolean values, and in my previous Javascript training I felt like I barely scratched the surface. *One of the things I really need to bear in mind while programming is to take the time to really understand certain tools. Otherwise, I won't be able to use my creativity to come up with appropriate solutions to programs.* Booleans are one of those tools where I need to develop a deeper understanding.

Naming Variables
1. **Don't start with a number**
2. Do not use **-** or **.**
3. No *keywords* or *reserved words*
4. All variables are case sensitive
5. Use the variable name to describe what is stored in the variable
6. Use camelCase!

## Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” only up to the section on switch statements (pp.145-162)

### Comparison Operators
| Operator | Description |
| ------- | ---------|
| == | Equal To |
| === | Strict Equal To |
| != | Not Equal To |
| !=== | Strict Not Equal To |

The above operators are the ones I need to have straight in my head. These are very importannt especially when trying to compare between strings, length of string, parsing an integer, etc.
