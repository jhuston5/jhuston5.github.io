# Linked Lists

## [Big O Notation](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-05/resources/big_oh.html)

What are the nuts and bolts to consider here? 

- Input size is *n* and considers both the number of values as well as the size of each value. Obviously, as *n* grows larger, so will the run time and memory space.

- Number of operations that are executed. (i.e. total lines of code)

- Number of "Basic Operations" that are executed (the most time consuming operation within the innermost loop)

### Memory Space

1. Amount of space to hold the code for the algorithm
2. Space needed to hold the input data
3. Space needed for output data
4. Amount of space needed (Working Space: creation of vars and references as it calculates. Stack Space: how memory use scales with the size of an input when utilizing recursion)

### Complexity

1. Constant: always uses the same time or space.
2. Logarithmic: as input size grows, complexity increases at a slower pace.
3. Linear: constant relationship between the size of the inputs and the memory space.

## [Linked List](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-05/resources/singly_linked_list.html)

> A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

1. Singly Linked List: Node only references the next Node.
2. Doubly Linked List: Node references both next and previous Nodes.
3. Head: first node in Linked List
4. Includes: Check if our linked list has a specific value
5. Current: Node we are currently on

Linked list cannot use foreach or for loops. The best way is to use a while loop. This ensures that we can check in each iteration if a node is null (this will cause the program to crash)

Big O time for Includes = O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list.
Big O space for Includes = O(1) - no additional space besides the input

How do Linked Lists differ from arrays?
Memory storage for arrays are linear, while storage for linked lists are scattered.

The benefit is that a linked list can be updated dynamically much more easily than a linear data structure like an array.
