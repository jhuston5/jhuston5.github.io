# Hash Tables

This seems like a really cool data structure. Essentially, a hash table is a list that stores key-value pairs at each index in the list. This key-value pair is run through a hash, which uses the string/integer to create a (hopefully) unique index number. The reading suggests that we can use ASCII characters added together, multiplied by a prime, modulo by 1024. I'm sure there are other methods, but essentially it is trying to use the characteristics of the key-value pair to generate a hash key.

We can then "unhash" the value to retrieve it from the hash table. I like the quick lookup that this provides O(1) vs O(n) since we are not iterating through the same list. We also handle collisions (instances of multiple values being stored in the same index) by making each index a bucket that contains a short linked list. If each linked list only contains single digit values, we can easily compare that to the target value the user wants.
