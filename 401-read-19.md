# Reading 19 - Regex

Used Regex in 301; it is used in many server-side applications to ensure common expressions like email address and phone numbers are correct.

To bring in regex:
import re

Functions:

- compile(): turn a regex pattern into a regex object
- search(): look through a string to find the first location that has a match to regex.
- findall(): Finds all the possible matches in the entire sequence and returns them as a list of strings
- sub(): It returns the string obtained by replacing or substituting the leftmost non-overlapping occurrences of pattern in string by the replacement
- split(): This splits the strings wherever the pattern matches and returns a list

> copyfile() copies the contents of the source to the destination and raises IOError if it does not have permission to write to the destination file.

```Python
# shutil_copyfile.py
import glob
import shutil

print('BEFORE:', glob.glob('shutil_copyfile.*'))

shutil.copyfile('shutil_copyfile.py', 'shutil_copyfile.py.copy')

print('AFTER:', glob.glob('shutil_copyfile.*'))
```

## Copying File Metadata

> By default when a new file is created under Unix, it receives permissions based on the umask of the current user. To copy the permissions from one file to another, use copymode().

``` Python
# shutil_copymode.py
import os
import shutil
import subprocess

with open('file_to_change.txt', 'wt') as f:
    f.write('content')
os.chmod('file_to_change.txt', 0o444)

print('BEFORE:', oct(os.stat('file_to_change.txt').st_mode))

shutil.copymode('shutil_copymode.py', 'file_to_change.txt')

print('AFTER :', oct(os.stat('file_to_change.txt').st_mode))
```
