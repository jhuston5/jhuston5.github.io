# FileIO & Exceptions

## [Read & Write Files in Python](https://realpython.com/read-write-files-python/)

Some basics. A file is a bunch of bytes for storing data, and this file is translated into binary for a computer to read.

Structure:

1. Header
2. Data
3. End of file (EOF)

### File Paths

- Folder Path: the file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are separated by a forward slash / (Unix) or backslash \ (Windows)
- File Name: the actual name of the file
- Extension: the end of the file path pre-pended with a period (.) used to indicate the file type

Some more directory basics here - we can use the .. to traverse directories, as well as refer to a file that is one directory up from our current working directory (cwd)

Line Endings - essentially these can be a bit tricky depending on whether you are using Windows/Mac or Unix, so just have to account for that. Another thing that can trip you up is Character Encoding. 
> This translates the byte data to something we can read, and the most common ways to translate are ASCII and UNICODE. ASCII only stores 128 characters while Unicode has up to 1,114,112 characters

We need to always make sure a file is closed - one method is to use a try-finally (which looks similar to a try-catch to me)

``` Python
reader = open('dog_breeds.txt')
try:
    # Further file processing goes here
finally:
    reader.close()
```

We can also use the with to close files up, such as in this case.

```python
with open('dog_breeds.txt') as reader:
    # Further file processing goes here
```

Once we open a file to read (using the -r command), we can iterate through the file using either .readlines() or just looping over the object itself.

Example Code:
```python
>>> with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader:
>>>     # Read and print the entire file line by line
>>>     for line in reader:
>>>         print(line, end='')
```


## [Exceptions in Python](https://realpython.com/python-exceptions/)

Exceptions differ from syntax errors in that syntax errors are problems with the actual structure of the python code itself (incorrect parenthesis, indentations, etc.)

### Exceptions

> This type of error occurs whenever syntactically correct Python code results in an error. The last line of the message indicated what type of exception error you ran into.

We can also raise exceptions, usually to throw up a flag when an action happens that we do not want.

### Try and Except

We can use these keywords to catch exceptions.

> An except clause within a code block will "determine how our program responds to exceptions.

Example Code: 
```python
try:
    linux_interaction()
    with open('file.log') as file:
        read_data = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError as fnf_error:
    print(fnf_error)
except AssertionError as error:
    print(error)
    print('Linux linux_interaction() function was not executed')
```
In this code we are trying this function, and if it does not work, we move to the except clause and give an alert very similar to try-catch in JS. We can also store different error codes to be thrown in different instances.

**One thing to avoid is a blank except clause. No error codes will be caught if this occurs**

Lastly we have *else* and *finally*. Else handles anything not included in the try-except, while finally is always run and can be used like Newman in Seinfeld (ie the Cleaner)
