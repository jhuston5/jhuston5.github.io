# [Modifying the Behavior of a Python Scope](https://realpython.com/python-scope-legb-rule/#modifying-the-behavior-of-a-python-scope)

## Scope

One term I found useful when reading this article right off the bat was the LEGB rule.

This stands for:

- Local
- Enclosing
- Global
- Built-In

Scope is similar to namespace. Namespaces are dictionaries that map names to objects. When we assign a variable, create a function, import a module, etc. the namespace is updated.

We can use the function sys.__dict__.keys() to access the namespaces.

1. Local: code block of a Python function. We will have as many local scopes as number of times the function has been called.

2. Enclosing: Used when local scope is an inner or nested function. The in-between layer of local scope and a nested function.

> Last but not least, you can’t modify names in the enclosing scope from inside a nested function unless you declare them as nonlocal in the nested function.

3. Global: top most scope. These names/assignments are visible at every level of the program.

4. Built-in: created whenever we run a program or open up a test session. This includes attributes built into Python.

### global Keyword

BLUF: don't use *global* as it can cause buggy and confusing code.

> Modifying global names is generally considered bad programming practice because it can lead to code that is:

> Difficult to debug: Almost any statement in the program can change the value of a global name.
> Hard to understand: You need to be aware of all the statements that access and modify global names.
> Impossible to reuse: The code is dependent on global names that are specific to a concrete program.

Global: can use this keyword on variables inside a function, which will change a variables scope from local to global. Any changes made to the variable within the function will then be reflected on the global scope.

*Lazy* global variables can also lead to buggy code.

### nonlocal Keyword

*nonlocal* allows a variable that can be accessed from a nested function (ie. *enclosed scope*) to be updated/modified. Without the *nonlocal* keyword these variable can be referred to, but not changed.

Example Code Block:

``` Python
>>> def func():
...     var = 100  # A nonlocal variable
...     def nested():
...         nonlocal var  # Declare var as nonlocal
...         var += 100
...
...     nested()
...     print(var)
...
>>> func()
200
```

> Unlike global, you can’t use nonlocal outside of a nested or enclosed function. To be more precise, you can’t use a nonlocal statement in either the global scope or in a local scope.

### Misc

**Import** allows you to bring in modules that are then assigned scope and can be accessed from namespaces.

Class scope review:
> Unlike functions, the class local scope isn’t created at call time, but at execution time. Each class object has its own .__dict__ attribute that holds the class scope or namespace where all the class attributes live.

*globals()* function will return a dictionary of everything within the current global scope.

*vars()* returns everything with a dictionary attribute.

*dir()* returns everything in the current Python scope.

## Big O

Time Complexity: how long an algorithm takes to do something
Space Complexity: how much memory it takes up while its doing so.

Way to compare algorithms to each other, and how it will perform when we scale data.

Is time complexity ***Constant, Logarithmic, Linear***?
