TLDR: Communicate!

Talk through your thought process from the get go.

Some easy steps to form thoughts.

1. Restate the question
2. Ask about edge cases
3. Ask about test cases (& sample data)
4. Write pseudocode and ask if it makes sense

## [Aceing a Programming Interview](https://medium.com/@steve_45636/6-tips-to-ace-a-whiteboard-programming-interview-f06c1b378bc6)

1. Take a few minutes
Seems counterintuitive to the above, but I actually agree. Take a moment to be quiet, gather thoughts,then start communicating.

2. Write down steps of the solution
Writing the algorithm, pseudocode, or code comments.

3. Write pseudocode first.

4. Donâ€™t sweat the small stuff.
Don't worry too much about syntax and things of that nature. Just be prepared to discuss what you want to do and how you would look it up.

5. Sit down. Be humble.
Stay relaxed and calm during an interview. This will be just one of many if we are doing things right.

6. Come prepared.
Self-explanatory.
