# Reading 18 Cryptography

Julius Caesar used to encrypt his messages by shifting the two sets of alphabets so every letter has a substitution. The message looks like nonsense, but knowing the key makes it simple to decipher.

Nowadays this is too simple, and there are logical methods to break a cypher like this.

- Frequency Analysis: identify frequence of characters compared to the frequency of use of letters in the language.
- Known plaintext: using a part of a message that might be common (Dear Abby, German Enigma Weather Reports)
- Brute Force: read out each one until you get a sensible message

Although this encryption method is now outdated, it is a foundation for many modern techniques.

Security Engineers use defense in depth to protect information.

Now that computation techniques are too far advanced for tools like the Caesarean Cipher, we use tools like a columar transposition cypher, which uses a grid size and direction as a key.

Decryption uses the key to decipher information.

### Data Encryption Standard

1977 created a standard that had 2^56 bits, or 72 quadrillion keys. By 1999 this could be brute force beaten in 2 days.

2001 introduced advanced encryption standard with 128 bit keys. Would take trillions of years even with all the computing power on the planet today.

Now, computers use one way functions to agree on a secret key without ever sending it over pubic internet (Diffie Hellman)
