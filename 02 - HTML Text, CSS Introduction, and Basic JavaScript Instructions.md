From the Duckett HTML book:

## Chapter 2: “Text” (pp.40-61)
## Chapter 10: Ch.10 “Introducing CSS” (pp.226-245)
From the Duckett JS book:

## Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.53-84)

Variables and Data Types
- Numeric
- String
- Boolean

There's so much that one can do with Boolean values, and in my previous Javascript training I felt like I barely scratched the surface. *One of the things I really need to bear in mind while programming is to take the time to really understand certain tools. Otherwise, I won't be able to use my creativity to come up with appropriate solutions to programs.* Booleans are one of those tools where I need to develop a deeper understanding.

## Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” only up to the section on switch statements (pp.145-162)
