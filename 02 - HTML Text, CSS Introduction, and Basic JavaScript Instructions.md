Variables and Data Types
- Numeric
- String
- Boolean

There's so much that one can do with Boolean values, and in my previous Javascript training I felt like I barely scratched the surface. *One of the things I really need to bear in mind while programming is to take the time to really understand certain tools. Otherwise, I won't be able to use my creativity to come up with appropriate solutions to programs.* Booleans are one of those tools where I need to develop a deeper understanding.

Naming Variables
1. **Don't start with a number**
2. Do not use **-** or **.**
3. No *keywords* or *reserved words*
4. All variables are case sensitive
5. Use the variable name to describe what is stored in the variable
6. Use camelCase!

## Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” only up to the section on switch statements (pp.145-162)

### Comparison Operators
| == | Equal To |
| === | Strict Equal To |
| != | Not Equal To |
| !=== | Strict Not Equal To |

The above operators are the ones I need to have straight in my head. These are very importannt especially when trying to compare between strings, length of string, parsing an integer, etc.
