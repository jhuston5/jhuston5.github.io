# Pythonisms

## Dunder Methods

"Magic" methods of Python. These allow us to mimic normal language methods of Python when using an empty class.

For example, using __init__ as a constructor:

```Python
class Account:
    """A simple account class"""

    def __init__(self, owner, amount=0):
        """
        This is the constructor that lets us create
        objects from this class
        """
        self.owner = owner
        self.amount = amount
        self._transactions = []
```

## Iterators

> Objects that support the __iter__ and __next__ dunder methods automatically work with for-in loops.

> Iterators provide a sequence interface to Python objects that’s memory efficient and considered Pythonic. Behold the beauty of the for-in loop!
> To support iteration an object needs to implement the iterator protocol by providing the __iter__ and __next__ dunder methods.
> Class-based iterators are only one way to write iterable objects in Python. Also consider generators and generator expressions.

## Generators

This is what the class looked like in its second (simplified) version:

```Python
class Repeater:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        return self.value
```

This is where Python’s generators enter the scene. If I rewrite this iterator class as a generator, it looks like this:

```Python
def repeater(value):
    while True:
        yield value
```

> Generator functions are syntactic sugar for writing objects that support the iterator protocol. Generators abstract away much of the boilerplate code needed when writing class-based iterators.
> The yield statement allows you to temporarily suspend execution of a generator function and to pass back values from it.
> Generators start raising StopIteration exceptions after control flow leaves the generator function by any means other than a yield statement.
