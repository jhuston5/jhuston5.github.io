## Read Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice. (10 minutes)

The concept discussed in this article is that deliberate practice involves seeking out parts of program that are still difficult and tackling them rather than retreating to areas that are easy/comfortable for us. I’ve experienced this already throughout the course as there are things that I am naturally better at, so I gravitate towards them. One of my goals is to list a couple of key concepts that I tend to avoid, and make a deliberate plan to improve on them.

## Watch Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset. (10 minutes)

I’d say in many areas I have a great growth mindset. Unfortunately I have recognized in recent years that there are a couple of technical areas that I feel I do not have confidence in my ability to grow and improve. After years of being in the “advanced” math classes, I had some poor algebra and precalculus teachers, which left me scared to pursue calculus in high school and college, and avoid math altogether in my higher education. This last year has been facing that fear and struggling to overcome the years of math deficiencies.

## Watch Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit. (6 minutes)

Angela is pretty famous for her theory that IQ does not equate to success in most areas of life. Her 7th grade students all had the capacity to learn given enough time and effort. IQ and natural talent certainly help, but if we know our own learning style and apply grit to learning, we can ultimately be successful. My favorite statement from Duckworth: “Grit is living life like it is a marathon, not a sprint”.

## Watch Alain de Botton on Redefining Success. (17 minutes)

Alain argues that it is easier than ever to make a good living, but it is much harder to be happy about what we are doing. I think one of the concepts he mentions, envy, plays a big role in determining whether we feel we are successful. I believe social media has exacerbated our feelings of job/socioeconomic success metrics. When we don’t hit those metrics Alain argues that we need to find ways to cope that we aren’t achieving “enough”. For me, I am trying to define my own success metrics slightly differently. Primarily It involves having good spiritual health and good relationships with my wife and extended family. Secondly, it involves doing some kind of meaningful work (the field doesn’t matter a whole lot) and growing within it.  

## Assess your emotional intelligence. If you have done it in the past, now you can identify the areas you have grown in recently

Two areas that I have traditionally been strong in include self-awareness and social awareness, but one I have struggled in is self-management. I am good at identifying things I should be doing or things that trigger reactions or behaviors. However, I still need to improve at executing suggestions to break habits or reactions that are detrimental.

## Assess your biases. If you have done it in the past, now you can identify the areas you have grown in recently.

After taking the assessment, I am strong in recognizing that I am biased and seeking out other viewpoints. I am weak at being willing to challenge the status quo or other biased actions particularly when I feel I am junior in a group or organization.
