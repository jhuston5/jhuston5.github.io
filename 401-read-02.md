# Testing and Modules

## [In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python](https://code.likeagirl.io/in-tests-we-trust-tdd-with-python-af69f47e6932)

Seems like writing unit tests first attempts to anticipate different inputs and outputs needed before the code is actually written.

Test names can be extremely descriptive, particularly in comparison to variable name. Should define what is expected and what is being tested.

> The test file name should follow the same name of module name. For instance, if our module is gender.py, our test name should be test_gender.py (Gomez)

**Keep test folder separate from production code**

### Cycle

- Write unit test = FAIL
- Write Feature = PASS
- Refactor code

*Ultimately TDD is thinking about software design first*

## [If name equals main](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-does-the-if-__name__-__main__-do/)

> If you import this script as a module in another script, the __name__ is set to the name of the script/module.
> Python files can act as either reusable modules, or as standalone programs.
> if __name__ == “main”: is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported.

Essentially, if__name__=="main" allows us to modularize or run programs on their own.

## Recursion

I had done some light reading on this when it was mentioned in class, and I read that recursion is when a function calls itself. I wasn't sure conceptually what it meant and I am still trying to wrap my head around it a bit.

This code was the easiest for me to understand:
approach(2) – Recursive adding 

```javascript
f(n) = 1                  n=1

f(n) = n + f(n-1)    n>1
```

It seems in most of the cases I've been looking at that a base case is used and when the function refers to itself it moves itself towards the base case.

Overall, one of the main reasons recursion is used is for simplicity and readability of code.
