# [Classes and Objects](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects)

> Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.

In other words, we use classes to make objects, which can store variables and functions and bundle them.

We can create classes, then call them multiple times and access their variables and functions.
```python
# define the Vehicle class
class Vehicle:
    name = ""
    kind = "car"
    color = ""
    value = 100.00
    def description(self):
        desc_str = "%s is a %s %s worth $%.2f." % (self.name, self.color, self.kind, self.value)
        return desc_str
# your code goes here

car1 = Vehicle()
car1.name = 'Fer'
car1.kind = 'convertible'
car1.color = 'red'
car1.value = 60000.00

car2 = Vehicle()
car2 = Vehicle()
car2.name = 'Jump'
car2.kind = 'van'
car2.color = 'blue'
car2.value = 10000.00
# test code
print(car1.description())
print(car2.description())
```

## [Thinking Recursively](https://realpython.com/python-thinking-recursively/)

I like the visual of Santa delegating work to elves to deliver presents to houses. The chart breaks down the same way recursive one does - going down until a base case is reached.

> Another good definition of recursion: a function that will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result.

Recursion adds a stack frame to the call stack until hitting the base case. Then, each call returns its results.

There are two ways we can maintain state with recursion.

- Thread the state through each recursive call so that the current state is part of the current callâ€™s execution context
- Keep the state in global scope

The author prefers threading, wich means we need to pass the updated current state to each recursive call as an argument. In layman's terms this means ensure the recursive equation has a accumulator function that will consistently updated and then returned in the base case.

Python also has a limit to how many stack frames it can call, so if we have a recursion problem that is extremely long, we need to keep it in mind.

## Pytest Fixtures and Coverage

**Test Suite** = writing multiple tests to check each path through our code.

**Paramatetrized Tests** = some tests that have similar characteristics (I believe we saw this in our Fibonacci and Lucas testing)

**Fixtures** = this is a bit over my head, but it sounds like eventually we will need objects that are used in multiple tests. ```pytest.fixure``` allows us to define a fixture and then use it in multiple tests.

We can use the ```pytest --cov``` command to also test for different exception errors.
