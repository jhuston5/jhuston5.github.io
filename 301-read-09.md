# Functional Programming

## Functional Programming Concepts

What is functional programming?

> From Wikipedia: Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

- So it seems that functional programming is trying to keep programs from having too much complexity that comes from mutable data.

What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

- A function is pure if it will return "the same result if given the same arguments" e.g. deterministic. Secondly, we want to discourage mutability because it can result in crazy side effects.

What are the benefits of a pure function?

- Results in code that is easier to test. From what little I know about testing it means we can reduce the amount of variability that will be introduced into the code, and thus reduce the amount of tests we have to write.

What is immutability?

- Immutability is when something is unchanging over time.
- Won't change the state of data after it is created. The workaround is to a create a new object with altered data.

What is Referential transparency?

> If a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.
>**pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency**

## Node JS

What is a module?

- Another Javascript file, splitting code up into logical modules depending on their specific functionality.

What does the word ‘require’ do?

- require means that the global object must utilize the required file or module.

How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

- require(./moduletorequire)

What do we have to do to make a module available?

- We have to use module.exports = (function we want available outside of the module)

### Things I want to know more about

- How to do we structure the pathing of our modules? For complicated programs do we just toss everything into a modules folder? Best practices to organize?
