## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack

What is a ‘call’?

- A call is a function invocation.

How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

- Calls can only be executed one at a time, resulting in a call stack.

What does LIFO mean?

- Last In First Out

>last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.

Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

What causes a Stack Overflow?

> A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point.

To me this seems simlar to an infinite WHILE loop.

## JavaScript error messages

What is a ‘refrence error’?

- A reference error is trying to use a variable that is not yet declared.

What is a ‘syntax error’?

- A syntax error is incorrectly structuring an object, function, or method.

What is a ‘range error’?

- A range error is giving an invalid length to an object.

What is a ‘tyep error’?

- A type error is when a type you are trying to access is not compatible. The author notes that the most common example is tyring to access an object's property when it is undefined.

What is a breakpoint?

> If the line you selected was run you will be able to see what has happened before that point and you can try and evaluate the next lines to check if everything is outputting what you are expecting.

What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?

- debugger allows you to see the history of the code before the debugger break point.

## Things I want to know more about

I really want to know how to use breakpoints effectively and write code in a way that is easy to test specific sections.
