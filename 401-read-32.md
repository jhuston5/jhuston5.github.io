# [Permissions](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/)

> Together with authentication and throttling, permissions determine whether a request should be granted or denied access.

I don't know what throttling is, but it seems that permissions are combined with authentication to access our APIs.

## Determining Permissions

> Permissions in REST framework are always defined as a list of permission classes.

> Before running the main body of the view each permission in the list is checked. If any permission check fails, an exceptions.PermissionDenied or exceptions.NotAuthenticated exception will be raised, and the main body of the view will not run.

## Object Level Permissions

Will allow a user to act on a specific object (typically a model instance)

### Limitations

> Often when you're using object level permissions you'll also want to filter the queryset appropriately, to ensure that users only have visibility onto instances that they are permitted to view.

> Because the get_object() method is not called, object level permissions from the has_object_permission() method are not applied when creating objects. In order to restrict object creation you need to implement the permission check either in your Serializer class or override the perform_create() method of your ViewSet class.
