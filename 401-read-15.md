## Terms

- Node: contains values and references to other nodes
- Root: Node at the beginning or top of the tree
- K: number that specifies the max number of children any node may have.
- Left: Binary tree, reference to one child node.
- Right:  Binary tree, reference to the other child node.
- Edge: link between parent and child node.
- Leaf: Node with no children.
- Height: # of edges from root to the furthest leaf.


## Traversals

### Depth First

> Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first. There are multiple ways to carry out depth first traversal, and each method changes the order in which we search/print the root. Here are three methods for depth first traversal:

**Pre-order:** root >> left >> right
**In-order:** left >> root >> right
**Post-order:** left >> right >> root

> The most common way to traverse through a tree is to use recursion. With these traversals, we rely on the call stack to navigate back up the tree when we have reached the end of a sub-path.

> Notice the similarities between the three different traversals above. **The biggest difference between each of the traversals is when you are looking at the root node.**

### Breadth First

Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node. 

> Traditionally, breadth first traversal uses a queue (instead of the call stack via recursion) to traverse the width/breadth of the tree. 

### Binary Search Trees

> A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of tree that does have some structure attached to it. In a BST, nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.

Seems to be very similar to a binary search of a sorted list - check if the value is greater than the middle, which would be the root in this case.
