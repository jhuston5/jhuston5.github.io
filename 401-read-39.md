# Next JS

Next JS is meant to make our developer experience setting up React apps easier. Next JS is a bit of a bridge between the abstraction that React provides and ease of use.

Built in Features:

- An intuitive page-based routing system (with support for dynamic routes)
- Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
- Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
- Client-side routing with optimized prefetching
- Built-in CSS and Sass support, and support for any CSS-in-JS library
- Development environment with Fast Refresh support
- API routes to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions
- Fully extendable

As we learned before, we use Link to be able to navigate pages.

To create new pages we can add a new JS file under the pages directory.

We can add static files, global CSS, and reusable React components with Next.js
